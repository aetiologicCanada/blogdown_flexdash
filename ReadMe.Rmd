```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

The goal here is to product flexdashboard output that can be accessed within a blogdown site.

Juanma opened an Rstudio Community Post on this in April, 2019. 

https://community.rstudio.com/t/blogdown-and-flexdashboard/27842

Which was followed up promptly by Rstudio staff pointing here: 

https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2017/09/06/adding-r-markdown-documents-of-other-output-formats/ 


That resulting in another post fron Juanma (7 April) which concluded: "and it seems it's not working".  Thereafter radio silence.
